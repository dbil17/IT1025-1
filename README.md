I created a flowchart that shows the logic of checking if a number is greater than 100. The file is named `PasswordLogic.pdf`.
# OOP in Python – Flower Example
## Purpose
This project demonstrates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python. The `Flower.py` file defines a `Flower` class, and the main function creates instances (objects) of the class and calls their methods to simulate the behavior of flowers growing and blooming.

### Files

1. **Flower.py** – This Python file contains the implementation of the `Flower` class, including methods to simulate growth and blooming. It also demonstrates object creation and method calls in Python's OOP.
   
2. **PythonOOP.png** – A screenshot showing the code and its output when executed. This file provides a visual representation of how the code works.

### How to Run
To run the Python file, simply execute `Flower.py` in any Python environment. The program will create and interact with three flower objects (Rose, Daisy, and Tulip).
